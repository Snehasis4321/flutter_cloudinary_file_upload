## Important
I have removed the `firebase_options.json` file , `.env` file and other credentials linked with this repo,
you need to initialize the app with your firebase project to test this app.

- make sure you initialize your own firebase project
  follow the steps shown in the video
  - like firebase login
  - fluttercli initialize
  - flutterfire configure
  - this will create and add the required files.
- and use your own cloudinary account for api and secret keys.
the `.env` will be in the root of the folders.
```bash
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="******"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="*****"
CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY="*****************"
```
Replace with your actual keys and create .env file.
